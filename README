I'm trying to learn Common Lisp. I'm playing with Emacs, SLIME and
SBCL.

This directory contains a list of CL-noob solutions to some of the
easier problems in Ed Karrels collection.

http://www.karrels.org/Ed/ACM/

To build & load:

(require :asdf)
(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'practice)

Most of the lisp files contain solution to a problem. Instructions on
playing with the code are at the start of each file.

There are also some files containing common utils.

The code is hereby declared public domain.

UPDATE: some problems from http://streamtech.nl/site/problem+set
